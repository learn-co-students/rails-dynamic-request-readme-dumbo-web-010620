# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:


p1 = Post.create(title: 'Chicken', description: 'Everything about chicken  ..... the end')
